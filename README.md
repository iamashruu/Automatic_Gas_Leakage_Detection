## Introduction

The Gas Leakage Detection System is designed to monitor the concentration of gas in the air and promptly notify users about any gas leakage. This system is particularly useful in environments where the presence of certain gases can be hazardous, such as in homes, industrial settings, or laboratories.

## Features

- Real-time gas concentration monitoring
- Audible and visual alerts upon gas detection
- Remote access and alerts through the Internet
- User-friendly interface for monitoring and control

## Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino UNO)
- Gas sensor module (e.g., MQ-5)
- Buzzer and LED for alerts
- Power supply and connectors
- Breadboard and jumper wires


## Usage

1. Assemble the circuit according to the provided circuit diagram.
2. Upload the Arduino sketch to the board using the Arduino IDE.
3. Power up the system and let it calibrate for a few minutes.
4. If the gas concentration exceeds the predefined threshold, the buzzer will sound, and the LED will light up.
5. The system can also send alerts to your smartphone or computer via the Internet using notifications.

## Results

The Gas Leakage Detection System effectively senses gas leaks and triggers alerts, ensuring timely responses to potentially hazardous situations. The project promotes safety and provides peace of mind by offering real-time monitoring and alerts.
